- **Line crossing**: counting rule based on crossing a virtual line.
- **Bucket**: a time interval group (15 minutes here).
- **mAP**: mean average precision (detection metric).
- **ID switch**: when the tracker changes identity of an object.
- **MAPE**: mean absolute percentage error (counting accuracy metric).
