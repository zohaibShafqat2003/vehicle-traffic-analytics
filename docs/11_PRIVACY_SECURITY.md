# 11 — Privacy & Security

## 🔍 Data Sensitivity
Traffic videos may contain:
- faces
- license plates
- location identifiers

## ✅ Minimum Privacy Practices
- Store videos in restricted access folders.
- Do not publish raw videos publicly.
- Use anonymized sample frames for reports when possible.

## ⚠️ Security Practices
- Do not hardcode paths or credentials.
- Log only operational stats (avoid sensitive imagery in logs).
- If cloud storage is used, ensure access controls.

## 📌 Ethical Notes 💡
- The system is for traffic analytics (counts), not identification.
- Avoid extending scope to surveillance features unless explicitly authorized.
